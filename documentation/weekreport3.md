# Week report 3

This week I did studying about the following subjects:

+ How to build the dictionary for decoding for Canonical Huffman Coding
+ How the LZW-algorithm works
+ How to implement my own ArrayList-class

I implement a functional ArrayList equivalent class, however, there is some issues with it. When compiled, it throws a warning about unsafe operation. Also, it allows different types of objects be put in the same list. I don't know if that is a big fault. Due to these reasons I did not yet use it in the Huffman class at all. I did write some tests for the List-class.

I also started writing the dictionary building for the Canonical decoding method, but I did not finish it, so it is temporarily commented out of the code.

The studying took about 4 hours, and writing the List-class and dictionary building code took about 3 hours, totaling to 7 hours used.

### What next

Next week I will finish the dictionary building and Huffman decoding using it. Also, I will start writing the LZW algorithm, and Dao-class.
