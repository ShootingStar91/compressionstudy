# Week report 7

The final week I used about 15 hours of time in total.

First I created a simple user interface, and with that also new performance tests for both algorithms. That took about 3 hours.

Then I wrote some unit tests for about 1 hour.

I adjusted the LZW bit length to 16 and noticed it gave better performance so I left it there.

Then I continued writing unit tests and integration tests and finished those, that took about 4 hours.

Then I ran performance tests many times to different files, analyzed them and wrote the testing document. Also I had to find suitable files for testing and put them together. This all took probably 4 hours together.

Then I wrote Javadoc comments, implementation document, and fixed checkstyle errors. That took about 2 hours.

Then I did some final checking and thus the project is finished, that took 1 hours.
