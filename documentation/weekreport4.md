# Week report 4

I am still writing the code of week 4.

I have heavily refactored the HuffmanCoder-class to work with a CByte-class I created, instead of working only with text files.

This has taken about 10 hours in total.

Unfortunately I could not get it into a shape that I could upload for the weekly deadline, so for now it is the last weeks version. I will upload Dao and CByte classes however.

### What next

Next I will start writing LZW-algorithm and replace the utility data structres with my own ones.
