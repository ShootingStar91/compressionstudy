# Week report 1

On first week, I chose the topic for the project. This included reading about different subjects. File compression was something I did not know much, and it seemed interesting, so I chose that.

I learned something about the basic ideas behind different lossless compression algorithms. They often had to do with ways to represent repeating patterns of bits. What is interesting is how different content of the data can make a great difference in the performance of the algorithm: If there is no repeating data, it is difficult to compress with this type of algorithm.

After choosing the topic and doing the basic study I wrote a requirement specification document, put up a github repository and registered it on labtool. I also read a lot of the course material, about what documentation should be like and what the course will contain.

### What next

Next week I will continue studying the algorithms and start drafting an algorithm for Huffman coding.
